Notes by project:

## Beta Distribution

[`testing_distrib.rmd`](testing_distrib.rmd) is the general explanation of motivation of the project. With methodology of beta distribution idea and some preliminary simulation.

[`Expected_Test_positivity_figure.R`](Expected_Test_positivity_figure.R): Generate figures for expected test positivity curves as a function of $\phi$ (shape parameter for beta distribution as "test focus"), testing proportion and prevalence.

-   [`./pix/test_positivity_vs_phi-test_prop.png`](./pix/test_positivity_vs_phi-test_prop.png): group by different test proportion

-   [`./pix/test_positivity_vs_test_proportion-phi.png`](./pix/test_positivity_vs_test_proportion-phi.png): group by different $\phi$ value

    -   @bbolker 's new color scaling applied

### Ratio of prevalence and test positivity(pos_prop)

Part of motivation for the project is find relationship into relationship between prevalence(prev) and test positivity(pos_prop)

[`inc-testing_positivity-ratio.R`](inc-testing_positivity-ratio.R): Try to dig further with the ratio of prev/pos_prop under different $\phi$ and test proportion(test_prop).

-   [`./pix/prev-pos_prop-ratio_prev_slice.png`](./pix/prev-pos_prop-ratio_prev_slice.png):prev/pos_prop ratio as a function of $\phi$, prev and test_prop, x-axis is $\phi$, grouped by different prev, and colored by test_proportion.

-   [`./pix/prev-pos_prop-ratio_test_prop_slice.png`](./pix/prev-pos_prop-ratio_test_prop_slice.png):prev/pos_prop ratio as a function of $\phi$, prev and test_prop, x-axis is test proportion, grouped by different prev, and colored by $\phi$.

    -   (TO DO) what happened at the jump/cusp??

### Methods of calculate expected testing positivity

We currently have four methods of calculating expected testing positivity(pos_prop) $\bar{p}$ for beta distribution based on formula discussed in Machinery of `testing_distrib.rmd`:

-   int: Integrating the beta function ourselves $$
    \bar{p}=\frac{\left(\int_{Q(1-t)}^1 B(y,\phi) y \, dy\right)}{1-\Phi_B(Q(1-t))} = 
    \frac{\left(\int_{Q(1-t)}^1 B(y,\phi) y \, dy\right)}{t}
    $$

-   cdf: Using cdf of beta distribution (pbeta function from base R) $$
    \bar{p}=\frac{CDF_{\beta}(Q(1-t),a+1,b)}{t}
    $$ where $a,b$ are shape parameter after parameterization by prevalence $i$ and $\phi$. $t$ is test proportion.

-   simp/log: Richard's formula / log version formula (equivalent but log version is slightly better for numerical calculation) as an explicit mathematical simplification of cdf method $$
    \bar{p}=i(1+\frac{Q(1-t)^a(1-Q(1-t))^b}{t a\mathbb{B}(a,b)})
    $$ where $\mathbb{B}(a,b)$ is the complete beta function.

-   est: Hybrid method of log and first order estimation based on cdf formula

    -   For lwr$=Q(1-t)>=1e^{-5}$ use log method
    -   For lwr$=Q(1-t)<1e^{-5}$ use first order estimation $$
        \bar{p} \approx \frac{b+1-(1-Q(1-t))ab}{b+1-(1-Q(1-t))(1-a)b}
        $$

All formula is write as function prop_pos_test_new on `testing_funs.R`.

[`Logspace_comparing_methods.R`](Logspace_comparing_methods.R): Comparing numerical result of methods on log space. Log-space Difference (heat-map color) are function of prevalence (y-axis), $\phi$(x-axis) and testing proportion-test_prop(group). For now, the differences are magnitude/absolute value, signs are considered due to log-space calculation, but temporarily ignored.

Difference of $log(x)-log(y)=0$ cases is highlighted by manually assign some value ($45$ in [`./pix/log-diff_cdf-log_simp.png`](./pix/log-diff_cdf-log_simp.png) or $40$ in [`./pix/log-diff_simp-log_simp.png`](./pix/log-diff_simp-log_simp.png)). These difference by definition is -Inf but could leads to confusion with the "real gray area" (NaN, caused by numerical flow of methods) in heat-map.

`betaParams.md`: (TO DO?) @dushoff 's suggestion to consider other parameterization of beta distribution shape parameter.

### Numerical issues

#### qbeta overflow

The "gray area" for extreme values (prevalence, $\phi \rightarrow 1$ leads to NaN and/or Inf values when calculating expected testing positivity (prop_pos). This is due to $Q(1-t)$ which is calculated by qbeta has numerical overflow and incorrectly gives $1$ for such extreme parameter values. These ranges shrink as test_prop increases.

-   [`./pix/log-diff_cdf-log_simp.png`](./pix/log-diff_cdf-log_simp.png) :"cdf" vs "log_simp":
-   [`./pix/log-diff_simp-log.png`](./pix/log-diff_simp-log.png) :"simp" vs "log_simp"

After fixing the denominator issue (qbeta appears in denominator, now is replaced by testing proportion), the "grey area" is away, since we no longer have zero denominator due to overflow. This shows difference between cdf and log simp method. (simp and log_simp seems merged). Now the previously "grey area" are not NaN values and all in yellow((-10,0) level log difference) in [`./pix/log-diff_simp-log.png`](./pix/log-diff_simp-log.png).

Still, in this "grey/yellow area", where numerical overflow leads to $Q(1-t)=1$ incorrectly, logsimp method gives $\bar{p}=i$ incorrectly. Near "grey/yellow area", log_simp might also generate numerical value $>1$ for $\bar{p}$. log_simp method works well when away from the "grey area".

-   (TO DO?) one way to "resolve" this is increase numerical accuracy of qbeta function in R. qbeta use a newton-like methods and limit the maximum iteration to 1000. Idea: we could try to recreate the algorithm in r level (available on Github) and then maybe try C level.

-   Anoter way "est": use log_simp when $Q(1-t)$ is away from $1$ (away from "grey area") and use first order estimation of "cdf" formula when it is close to 1

    -   Current boundary is set to $1e^{-5}$ (TO DO? better analysis). where the the estimation and log_simp are close enough, but before the log_simp starting to break down
    -   [`./pix/log-diff_est-log.png`](./pix/log-diff_est-log.png): "est" vs "log_simp" for whole parameter space:
    -   [`./pix/OLD-log-diff_est-log.png`](./pix/log-diff_est-log.png) 
    -   [`./pix/New-log-diff_est-log.png`](./pix/New-log-diff_est-log.png): Focus on a certain test proportion. OLD is estimation directly compare with log_simp. New is the hybrid "est" method compare with logsimp, grey area is where $Q>=1^e{-5}$ both method use log_simp formula. This is to show the boundary $1e^{-5}$ is reasonable
    -   [`./pix/slice_log_diff_est-logsimp.png`](./pix/slice_log_diff_est-logsimp.png): A more specific slice at $\phi=0.851$. The overflow problem of logsimp method is more obvious.

#### Qbeta vs qbeta

@bbolker previously have some other issue for qbeta some times generate error, so a Qbeta function is created in `testing_funs.R` to avoid error.

[`Qbeta_Issues.R`](Qbeta_Issues.R) is trying to see if qbeta will causing us such problems, thus if Qbeta is necessary.

-   [`./pix/log-diff_Qbeta-qbeta.png`](./pix/log-diff_Qbeta-qbeta.png): qbeta and Qbeta agree with each other on every point
-   [`./pix/qbeta_logsimp.png`](./pix/qbeta_logsimp.png): qbeta works fine with log_simp method
