The testing hazard for negatives is $b$, corresponding to a probability $p_n = 1-B$; for positives it is $b+h$, corresponding to a probability of $p_p = 1-BH$.

The probability that $T$ people are tested in a group is proportional to $p^T (1-p)^(X-T)$, where $X$ is the size of the group. The log-likelihood
