For now, we are considering a compartmental SIR like disease.

Currently, for both Beta distribution and Odd ratio model, at each time point $t$, the proportion of positive test $p$ and the proportion of all test $T$ are both determined by prevalence $Y=I/N$, which is the proportion of infected population at time point $t$.

$$ T= (1-Y) T_B + Y T_Y $$

$$ p= \frac{Y T_Y}{T}= \frac{1}{1+(\frac{1}{Y}-1)\frac{T_B}{T_Y}}$$

Based on $T$ and $p$, we determine the observed number of test $OT$ and observed number of positive test $OP$ at time $t$.

$$OT \sim \text{Binom}(N,T)$$

$$OP \sim \text{Binom}(OT,p)$$
Since $OT$ and $OP$ are both observed "incidence" at time $t$, a question would be if it is more reasonable to use incidence of infection $\frac{S(t)-S(t-1)}{N}$ when calculating the rates. 

What we are doing now with prevalence, is assuming that at each time point $t$, all active infected cases at the moment $I(t)$ are tested based on rate $T_Y$ and all other population $N-I(t)$ are tested based on baseline rate $T_B$. 

## Thoughts:
This might be more justifiable than using incidence, since being symptomatic/actively infected is a key factor for $T_Y \gg T_B$. From this perspective, it is problematic to directly link new infections to new positive tests (or with a delay?):
- Newly infected cases might be asymptomatic thus less possible to get tested
- While long infection duration time could also have more mild/ignorable symptomatic with less testing possibility due to self-recovery.). 
- Other reasons driven positive testing rate could be complicated and independent with time.
A harmonized uniform testing rate for all active infected population at the moment might be more reasonable.

With prevalence, the tendency of $OP$ is synchronized with prevalence $Y(t)$ and so does $OT$ in general as we assume $T_Y > T_B$.

$$ \frac{dT}{dt}=\frac{dT}{dY} \frac{dY}{dt}= (-T_B +T_Y)\times \frac{dY}{dt}$$

$$ \frac{dp}{dt}=\frac{dp}{dY}\frac{dY}{dt}= \frac{\frac{T_B}{T_Y}}{((Y-1)\frac{T_B}{T_Y}-Y)^2}\times\frac{dY}{dt}$$
A problem is if patient already tested positives are evenly likely to get tested as new infections. 

I think the key difference would be if the new infection dominantly derive the positive testing or the positive tests is more a mixture result of new and cumulative infection. Problem would be the data might not contain the new infections.

## JD's note
If we test everyone, we could then:
- Count the number of positives; this would allow us to calculate the exact prevalence
- Count the number of new positives, by some reasonable standard (e.g., >3 months since the last time this human has tested positive); this would allow us to calculate the exact incidence

When not everyone is tested, we still need to pay attention to whether we are counting positives or new positives. If we had reliable new case information, we would be solidly in the world of incidence, which would be good. Unfortunately, RVDSS and a lot of other non-emergency streams will not provide this information. In this case, interpretation is going to depend on whether people with recent positive tests are getting tested again. If they very rarely get tested again, weâ€™re back in the world of incidence. If whether they are tested again does not depend directly on the previous test result, then we are in the world of prevalence, which is almost as good. If we think we are in the middle, we can try to do a simple kludge (e.g. inc ~ positives/(1+$\delta$)) or try to model people who have a positive test in their recent history.

### Positive tests' impact on dynamic 
A related question would be if we need to consider impact to infection dynamic of those observed positive tests: 
- If they are positive in test, will they get recovered faster (take medication, treated, hospitalized, etc.) 
- And/or get less infective (self/administrative quarantined, wear masks, extra measurement etc.). 
- This impact might not be significant if $T_{prop}$ and/or $pos$ are small, thus can be ignored for simplicity.
- A potential solution is create a separate box for tested positive population
We might not consider this for now but will come back to this later
