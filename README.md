# testing_bias_distribution

Models to understand dynamics of test positivity under epidemic dynamics and biased testing

-   [web version](https://bbolker.github.io/testing_bias_distribution/)
-   [beta notes](docs/testing_distrib.html)
-   [simple interaction model](simple.md)
-   [RTMBode/fitode example](fitodeMCMC.R): not directly relevant, but hopefully a useful example of how to do trajectory-matching in `fitode` or `RTMBode`

Related projects. It's not super-clear we have any of sufficient interest, but JD is willing to share. We have a mathy publication with an earlier post-doc (Ali Gharouni, nice guy, now at PHO); Mike Li did some stuff during Covid which probably had some ideas but will be hard to figure out; JD advised some South African students who have a public repo, but it's not clear how far they got.
