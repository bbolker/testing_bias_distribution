Related projects. It's not super-clear we have any of sufficient interest, but JD is willing to share. We have a mathy publication with an earlier post-doc (Ali Gharouni, nice guy, now at PHO); Mike Li did some stuff during Covid which probably had some ideas but will be hard to figure out; JD advised some South African students who have a public repo, but it's not clear how far they got.
